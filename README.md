# YoloV5-Qt-Practice
Practicing using Yolo V5 to detect scaphoid with trash like user interface made with PyQt

## Depencies
`PyQt5` and `Pytorch` python packages are needed. 
`Pytorch` version 1.10, `CUDA` version 1.11, `python` version 3.7 (TAs don't use Arch Linux so they stay at 3.7)

## How to run

1. ~~Put some money in my paypal account: dppss92132 [at] gmail .com~~
2. `cd` to UI directory
3. `python Dooctor.py`
4. Enjoy the Dooctor. You may hear someone yelling "Medic! MEDIC!" You don't
   play TF2? Go play it and you'll understand me!

## Notes
- Model v5x trained with batch 4 and epoch 40. v5s or v5l may need more epochs.
- To fix my wonderful user interface, use Qt designer to open `UI/Dooctor.ui`
